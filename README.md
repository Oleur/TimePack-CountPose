## :scroll: Description
TimePack CountPose is a timer application to showcase Jetpack Compose animations.
Timer starts at 10s and you can 10 more seconds by clicking on the action menu.
When the timer starts, the wave animations is triggered and a dialog is shown at the end.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
For this application, my focus was to learn about Animation and Canvas.
The timer itself and the wave animations are done thanks to drawings on a Canvas (text + shapes).
This resources were quite helpful:
